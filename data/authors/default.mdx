## Why have this blog?

> To share whatever I learn

I have recently been inspired by the concept of "learning in public" which involves sharing my learning journey with others. This approach not only allows me to contribute my take on topics but also serves as a personal documentation of my progress.

I want to write about technical topics that I am learning and facing difficulties with, and share my thoughts through writing.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
