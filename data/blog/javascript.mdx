If you know other programming language and want to get started with JavaScript, this article will help you. Otherwise be ready to google things and you will be fine.


1. Undeclared variables are given "undefined" type as well as value 
	1. `var x`  :: this is undeclared but defined 
	2. But JavaScript will assign it's value as undefined 
2. Every declaration of variable or fun is hoisted at top of scope.
3. `var` has function scope
4. JavaScript religiously split  declaration + definition/assignment (var x = 10) to declaration then definition var x; x = 10
5. All undeclared variable are declared at time of execution in global scope. Yes so all of them are global implicitly.
6. `var` is function scoped, means it will be accessible in whole function while `let & const` are local scoped. 
7. Declaration means like `let x` Assignment/Definition/Intialization mean assigning value to it.

### This is not true that only `var` is hoisted also `let & const` are hoisted 

```js
console.log(number)
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'number' before initialization

let number = 10

console.log(number)
```

Notice the difference in error messages 

```js
console.log(number2)
// **ReferenceError: number2 is not defined**

let number = 10
```

So the thing is `let & const` are also hoisted but are not implicitly initialized/assigned with `undefined`


This is also called `temportal dead zone` were JavaScript is aware of the variable existence but it's not accessible to it. 

### How many primitive data types are there in javascript and what are they ?

What is primitive type anyways ?
 In javascript a primitve data type is data  type which is not an object and has no methods or properties. 


1. By definition only two type of primitive types may serve as object property values: 
	1. String type
	2. Symbol type
2. Even if you don't use string, for example you use number or boolean type it will also convert to string type to be used when indexing
3. Similarily for alert() it auto converts everything to string except `symbol` as it is not auto converted.


### Javascript Objects
1. created using Object() called object constructor or {} called object literal
2. Keys could accessed using `.` notation or using `[ ]` 
3. `[ ]` are really powerful, example allows variable computation and string at same time
	1. let x ="number"; obj[x] = 10
	2. or object["some"] = 20 
4. When defining inside of the object literal for variable as value we need to use `[ ]` to denote it's computed.
	1. let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy")
	2. ``` let bag = {
	3. [fruits] : 5, 
	4. };  ```

### Property value shorthand

```js
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
}
// will return object with name and age as object keys this is shorthand.
// could also use both shorthand and normal notation at same time.
```


```js
function sum(obj){
	for (key in obj){
		if (typeof obj[key] == "number")
		obj[key] = obj[key]*2
	}
}
```

### Methods of primitive ??
You may wonder how we can have methods in our primitive datatype like string or numbers for example.

So here is what happens, the language decided to keep it lightweight  but also give methods, so for that when we call any property on the primitives
	1. It will create a new wrapper object with that value 
	2. The operation on the data will performed and returned 
	3.
IN this way our operation is light and functionality is achieved for sure. 

### JavaScript is prototype based language.

Prototype is object itself which other objects could inherit and then extend the property of it.

Basically there are two types of OOPS
	1. Classical OOP
	2. Prototypical OOP

Prototypical OOP :: Here classes doesn't inherit from each other but objects inherits other object. At heart it is similar to inheritance. 

So every object must have  a prototype, yes every object has by default `[[protype]]` defined internally which is used to assign when creating objects. 

So if you want to create object with your custom `prototype` then you should use `Object.create()` to do so. Also, you can use `__proto__` to change the type to some other types if required. 

Also remember `__proto__` is outdated JavaScript recommends to use `Ojbect.setPrototypeOf(obj, property)` but since `__proto__` is required by language specification. 

### Property retrieval mechanism

When property is accessed on a given object in javascript, if that property exists on the object then it's used or otherwise searching moves to the next prototype down the chain.


### Property assignment mechanism

If something is un-writable or don't allow modification then if you try to write that property it will be ignored for the whole prototype chain.


> One important thing to note is that `.this` will not follow the prototype rules, it will just use the current object to perform so, there is one interesting case which you should look onto.

```js
let hamster = {
  stomach: [],

  eat(food) {
    this.stomach.push(food);
  }
};

let speedy = {
  __proto__: hamster
};

let lazy = {
  __proto__: hamster
};

// This one found the food
speedy.eat("apple");
alert( speedy.stomach ); // apple

// This one also has it, why? fix please.
alert( lazy.stomach ); // apple
```



### Type conversion

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given tot them to the right type.

example: alert() converts to string, also you can see how objects keys are automatically converted to strings except for symbol.

If you explicity convert something to say `Number()` and if the conversion of that string is not possible then it will return `NULL`.

So here is few rules for numeric conversion.

![[Pasted image 20230914153054.png]]


Two common point of errors of this conversion: 
1. `undefined` is NAN, not 0
2. "0" or "   " in Boolean is not 0, it's 1 because it is not empty.

### Indexed collections

#### Array

```js
// This...
const arr1 = new Array(arrayLength);

// ...results in the same array as this
const arr2 = Array(arrayLength);

// This has exactly the same effect
const arr3 = [];
arr3.length = arrayLength;

```

This all creates array with specified length, if you want to create array with 1 element you can't use Array constructor or function call, you can only use `[ ]` notation.

> If you supply non-integer value to the array operator, a property will be created, instead of array element.

> To change length just change `.length()` property of the array and it will work. Yes both truncate and size increase.

> Don't use `for..in` loops because normal elements and all enumerable properties will be listed. Use `.foreach()` or `for..of` with length checks

Array some common known methods are:  `.concat() .join("-") .push(), .pop() .shift() .unshift() .slice() .at() .splice() .reverse() .flat() .sort(). indexOf() .lastIndexOf() .forEach()` and many [more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#populating_an_array:~:text=will%20be%20listed.-,Array%20methods,-The%20Array%20object) 

`shift` : is used to remove elements from front, for ex to remove first element use `arr.shift()`
`unshift`: is used to to add elements add `front. arr.unshift("4", "5")`

Arrays have their own implementation of `.toString()` method that returns a comma-separated list of elements. 

```js
let arr = [1,2,3];

alert(arr); // 1,2,3
alert(String(arr)) // "1,2,3"
```

So if you do something like `[1,2,3] + 3` Array will call `String()` method on it. 

##### NO special treatment for array 

So like the whole treatment with Objects, `==` or `===` works same with array objects.

Let's see the rules of `==` in brief.
1. Two objects are equal == only if they’re references to the same object.
2. If one of the arguments of == is an object, and the other one is a primitive, then the object gets converted to primitive, as explained in the chapter Object to primitive conversion.
3. …With an exception of null and undefined that equal == each other and nothing else.

> So the only way to compare the Array is to just use the item by item comparison


#### Typed Arrays

It basically contains 2 things
	1. `ArrayBuffer`( ) :: It is used to allocate the number of bytes required. But it doesn't provide access to those data for that 
	2. `DataView`(`arrayBufferInstance`):: You could choose to use different view type for this and then pass it, so that we can have all read/write methods.

### Keyed Collections 

Data which are indexed by a key; `Map` and `Set` objects contain elements which are iterable in the order of the insertion. 

> The main difference in `map` and `object` is that `map` allows keys of any type.

> If you use `[ ]` notation with Keyed types you are treating it as same as `Objects` which means limitations like key can be strings or symbols.

So just use the standard ways like `.set()` , `.get()` 

> One interesting thing to know is you can also use `Object` as key in `map` or `set` but you can only use one object as key in `Objects` also which will convert it's key to `object Object`

`map.set()` return the map itself, so you could chain it.

Sure there is way to convert object to map using `new Map(Object.entries(obj))` or other way around Object from map `Object.fromEntries(map)`

##### A set is special type collection - "set of values" (without keys), where each value may occur only once. 

Set is much better optimized internally for uniqueness checks. HOW ? 

> The funny thing is `.foreach(value, valueAgain, set)` value is passed 2 times, this is for comptability reasons.

For example `set.keys()` and `set.values()` both returns `set.keys()` also `set.entries()` returns and iterable object for entries `[value, value]` all of this exists for compatibility with `Map`.
