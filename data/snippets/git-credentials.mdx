import Twemoji from './Twemoji.tsx'

> This is not safe (use SSH instead) your password will be store in plain text file in `~/.git-credentials` 

1. `git config --local credential.helper store`
2.  `git pull`
3. `Enter username and password/token and it will be saved`

I choose this method over SSH for very specific usecase. I authorized one repository with github's fine
grained token in work machine and stored it's credentials in plain .txt file, again remember not safe.
