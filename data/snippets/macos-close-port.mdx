Sometimes we can't run a server as the Port number is used by some other process. So in that case we require to do two thing: 
1. Find the PID of process which is using that Port.
Find the PID 
```bash
sudo lsof -i :5955
```
2. Kill that process
```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```








Happy freeing! <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />
